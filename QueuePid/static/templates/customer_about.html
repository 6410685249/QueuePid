            <h1> About Queuepid </h1>
            <p> Our goal is to create a website that provides restaurant reservation services
                for people who do not have free time or do not want to queue in front of the restaurant.</p>
            <p> Nowadays, many restaurants are widely popular. This requires a lot of time waiting
                and queuing to use the service. It makes many customers feel like they're wasting their time
                and want to use this time waiting in queue to do other personal business</p>
            <p> In our vision, this website is the helper to help you save your time by waiting
                in a restaurant queue instead you while you are using your valuable time. </p>
